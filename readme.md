- This project aims to develop a comprehensive registration portal for the summit. The portal caters to multiple user types, including students, campus ambassadors, professionals, and startups. Each user type is assigned a personalized dashboard with specific functionalities tailored to their needs.

- Vue.js powers the frontend, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface, while Django serves as the robust backend framework. The interaction between the frontend and backend is facilitated through a RESTful API, ensuring seamless communication.

- To secure user interactions, the project employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, adding an extra layer of security and authentication. This enables secure access and ensures the integrity of user data throughout the registration process.

- For data management, the project utilizes the MySQL database, a reliable and scalable solution. This choice ensures efficient storage and retrieval of information, contributing to the overall performance and reliability of the registration portal.

- In summary, the combination of Vue.js, Django, RESTful API, JWT authentication, and MySQL database forms a powerful and integrated technological foundation for the success of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit's registration portal.
